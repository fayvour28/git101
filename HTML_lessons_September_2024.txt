HTML Lessons: September 2024

================================

Day 1: Friday, 27 September 2024
Topic: HTML Lists and Nested Lists

Objective: By the end of today’s lesson, you will understand how to create ordered and unordered lists and how to nest lists within each other.

Ordered Lists (numbered)
Unordered Lists (bulleted)
We’ll also learn about nested lists, which are lists inside other lists.

1. Ordered Lists (<ol>)
Ordered lists are used when the order of items matters. For example, if you're listing your top 3 favorite fruits, you would use an ordered list so that the items appear numbered.

Explanation:
The <ol> tag stands for ordered list.
Inside the <ol> tag, each item is placed within an <li> tag (list item).
The browser automatically numbers the items for you.


2. Unordered Lists (<ul>)
Unordered lists are used when the order doesn’t matter, and you just want to display a simple list of items with bullet points. For example, if you want to list random items like different hobbies, you would use an unordered list.

Explanation:

The <ul> tag stands for unordered list.
Each item within an unordered list is also placed in an <li> tag.
The browser automatically adds bullet points (instead of numbers) to the list items.
3. Nested Lists
Nested lists are lists that are placed inside another list. You can have a list within a list to show a relationship between items.

Explanation:

A nested list simply means a list inside another list.
You can nest an unordered list inside an ordered list or another unordered list.
This is helpful when you need to categorize items further.
Assignment for Day 1:

Create a webpage that contains:
An ordered list of 3 countries you'd like to visit.
An unordered list of your favorite books.
A nested list where you categorize the books into genres (e.g., Fiction, Non-fiction).

Day 2: Sunday, 29 September 2024
Topic: HTML Forms

Objective: By the end of this lesson, you will understand how to create a simple form using HTML, which includes input fields, labels, and a submit button.

What is an HTML Form?
- An HTML form is a section of a webpage that allows users to enter data and send it to a server.
- Forms are essential for collecting user information, such as names, email addresses, and other input data.

Basic Structure of a Form:
- The form is defined by the <form> tag. All the elements that collect user data are nested within this tag.

Key Elements of a Form:
1. Form Tag (<form>):
   - The <form> element creates the form container.
   - Attributes may include:
     - action: Specifies where to send the form data when submitted.
     - method: Specifies how to send the data (GET or POST).

2. Input Fields (<input>):
   - The <input> element creates various types of fields for user input.
   - The type attribute defines what kind of input field it is (text, email, password, etc.).

3. Labels (<label>):
   - The <label> element defines labels for input fields, improving accessibility.

4. Submit Button (<button> or <input type="submit">):
   - Creates a button that users click to submit the form.

Complete Example of a Simple Form:
- Create a form with fields for:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Message
  - A submit button

Assignment for Day 3:
Create a simple form that asks for the user’s:
   - Name
   - Email address
   - Message
   - Include a submit button

BONUS TIPSSS
<!DOCTYPE html>
This tells the browser that you are writing an HTML5 document. Every HTML document starts with this declaration.


<html lang="en">
The <html> tag marks the start of the HTML document.
The lang="en" attribute indicates that the document is written in English.


<head>
The <head> section is where you include metadata about the webpage (information not visible to the user).
Inside the <head> tag:
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Ensures your page uses the correct character encoding.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This makes the page responsive to different screen sizes (useful for mobile devices).
